# Tesla Prep

A comprehensive guide on preparing for, taking delivery of, and owning a Tesla Model 3.

I couldn't find a good resource for the soup-to-nuts process of buying a Model 3, so I made one. This document is adapted from Will Fealey's UK-based [guide](https://fealey.co.uk/tesla/things-to-check-when-you-pick-up-your-tesla/577) on the Model S. It's been Americanized and edited for the Model 3, with many new links and additional resources since Will's was originally written.

## Start
Congratulations! You've configured a Model 3. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

You'll receive an email from Tesla saying something to the effect of "We'll be in touch!" Do not get financing quotes at this time. They expire after 30-days, and you will need to re-run credit checks.

Depending on your financing choice during configuration, you'll see an "Edit Design" button on your account page all the way up until your car starts being built (this can be in as little as ten days before taking delivery). If you elected the "Cash" option for financing, your "Edit Design" button will disappear immediately, but it is still accessible by visiting https://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount/edit-design/RNXXXXXXXXXXX. Use this link to (relatively) officially check the status of your order up to 7 days before your delivery date.

### First contact
You will eventually be contacted by a Tesla Delivery Advisor/Scheduler who will confirm your delivery date. Make sure your Tesla account reflects this date.

### <30 days before delivery
Now is the time to get financing quotes from credit unions, banks, etc. Whatever quotes you get, if your credit history is excellent, use [Lightstream](https://www.lightstream.com/) to get an unsecured cash loan. They will beat any approved rate you send them.

Ensure you have the routing/account number of the account(s) you will be transferring funds from on delivery day (especially important on weekends).

### <10 days before delivery
If applicable, finalize your financeer.

Your "Edit Design" button and/or back-door link should stop working. If it doesn't, your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

### <7 days before delivery
Check your account for an assigned Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA). If they are not showing up, the back-door method is to try buying a [Tesla Wall Connector](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/product/vehicle-accessories/model-s_x_3-wall-connector.html). When you're checking out, if it says "No VIN assigned," you truly do not have a VIN. Your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

If you have a VIN, call your insurance to schedule the coverage date.

## Before you take delivery, you should:
1.  Watch the [Model 3 walkthrough videos on the support section of Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos). These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process.
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no), these pages go over details on financing, trade-ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
4.  [Get a home charger installed](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation). Tesla has [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.
5.  [Download and read a copy of the owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf). It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.
6.  Read [What They Don't Tell You When You Buy an Electric Car](http://10ways.com/save/travel/car/what-they-dont-tell-you-when-you-buy-an-electric-car/9792)
7.  Grab a [good tire inflator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224N1U?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAR8J).
8.  Join the [official Tesla forum](https://forums.tesla.com/), the unofficial [Tesla Motors Club forum](https://teslamotorsclub.com/), and [r/teslamotors](http://reddit.com/r/teslamotors) subreddit.

## On delivery day, prior to arrival:
1.  Have the Tesla app installed on your smartphone prior to arrival for delivery.
2.  Bring your driver’s license.
3.  If your car will be registered to more than one person, each person on the registration needs to be at the delivery appointment to sign final documents.
4.  Bring written or digital proof of your down payment having been made and the final payment details or financing details.  If you are financing your car, make sure your loan has been funded before you arrive to take delivery and that you have some kind of proof you can provide to Tesla should they ask about it.
5.  Bring a printed insurance card or other proof of insurance that shows your Model 3 is insured.
6.  Since the delivery area where you will inspect your Model 3 may be dark, bring a flashlight.

2.  Attempt to pair your smartphone to your car over Bluetooth.

## Post-inspection:
### Verify post-delivery vehicle records
1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your car is marked as DELIVERED in Tesla's network. There have been reports of cars being delivered and the phone app doesn't allow log-in the following day. This is due to the oversight of the car not being identified as having been delivered in Tesla's system.
2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement. If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Tesla account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.

You can additionally check the [Master Model 3 Delivery Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gw13-SKi_XQkooBmWKUunrtL6GO-g8PKSJAl1eLPsJU/edit)

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is known to rectify these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day, you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*
